This package constructs metric graphs, represented as adjacency matrices weighted by edge lengths. 
It also solves the eigenvalue equation for the Laplace operator on the edges of a graph, with continuity and Kirchhoff's law at the vertices.

The types of graphs available are:
    - Delaunay triangulations of the unit disc
    - Spiderweb within the unit disc
    - Geodesic and Goldberg polyhedra (icosahedron -> soccer ball -> etc)
